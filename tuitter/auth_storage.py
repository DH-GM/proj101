"""Token persistence helpers for tuitter.

This module provides a single canonical writer and reader for the full
token blob. Historically the codebase used a variety of shapes (separate
`refresh_token` entries, a small `username` key, or an entire JSON blob).
We normalize to one shape: the full token dict is stored under the key
`oauth_tokens.json` (in keyring when available) or in a fallback file.

Functions:
  - save_tokens_full(tokens: dict, username: Optional[str]) -> None
  - load_tokens() -> Optional[dict]  # returns {'tokens': {...}, 'username': '...'}
  - clear_tokens() -> None
